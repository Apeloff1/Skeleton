# Application Assembly

This repository is being consolidated into one coherent application while
preserving the internal boundaries that already carry production behavior.

The canonical application boundary is now the `skeleton.app` package plus
`skeleton/app/manifest.json`. Docker Compose remains the process supervisor;
the assembly layer gives the repository one topology, one preflight contract,
and one operator command.

## Application surfaces

| Service | Role | Public development endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend` | Expo / browser interface | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `backend` | Tutolage application API | `http://localhost:8001` |
| `skeleton` | Skeleton v16 engine API | `http://localhost:8010` |
| `mongo` | durable state | local-only host binding |
| `chroma` | optional vector store | `http://localhost:8000` with `--full` |

The backend and Skeleton API remain separate processes during consolidation.
Combining them prematurely would create route, dependency, startup, and
security regressions. They are one application at the operational boundary
and can be progressively reconciled behind that boundary.

## Canonical commands

```bash
# Inspect topology
python -m skeleton app status

# Structural repository validation
python -m skeleton app check

# Validate Docker plus required runtime environment
python -m skeleton app check --runtime

# Build and start the core application
python -m skeleton app up

# Include optional Chroma
python -m skeleton app up --full

# Inspect / operate
python -m skeleton app ps
python -m skeleton app logs backend
python -m skeleton app logs -f
python -m skeleton app config
python -m skeleton app down
```

The CLI never uses a shell to construct Docker commands. Service names are
validated against the manifest before they are passed to Compose.

## Runtime configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set at least:

- `MONGO_URL`
- `SKL_MONGO_URI`
- `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`

Optional provider/payment/seal values remain optional until the corresponding
feature is used. `app up` fails closed when required runtime values are empty
or obvious placeholders.

## Assembly rules

1. New user-facing capabilities should attach to one of the declared service
   boundaries, not create another top-level application.
2. New long-running services must be added to both Docker Compose and the
   application manifest in the same change.
3. Browser-facing environment variables must use host-resolvable URLs. Docker
   service DNS names are internal implementation details and must not be
   embedded into the exported frontend bundle.
4. `python -m skeleton app check` is the minimum structural regression gate
   for assembly work.
5. Existing subsystem PRs should reconcile into
   `integration/app-consolidation` rather than create a competing assembly
   trunk.
